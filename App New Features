• The Tips window got a whole lot more powerful:

• In the Actions window of Tips, type ‘tracker’ to quickly open the spreadsheet with links to the issue’s work. Or type ‘artwork’ to open the SCJ Artwork folder in Finder. Or ‘guide’ for the folder with the InDesign file. Or ‘what can you do’ for an overview of the app.

• Did you know? If you need a flyer or a poster printed, you could already use the Actions window to find and contact the duplicating offices on campus. Type ‘duplicating.’

• Multiple user accounts on your computer can now use the SCJ app, each with their own independent settings.

• Richer, more consistent and intelligent notifications.

• Log in as the senior designer to disable Adobe compatibility checks, or completely uninstall or reset the SCJ app.
