New in March:

• In the Actions window of Tips, type ‘export’ to quickly export the magazine, or ‘preview for senior designer’ to start a quick preview PDF without choosing between formats. You can still drag-and-drop the InDesign document on the SCJ app icon to do this, just like before.

• We‘ll warn you if you have extra InDesign documents located in the design guides folder. Here‘s why: if improperly prepared, unrelated documents can potentially bring their own issues, such as misleading missing font or link errors unrelated to your work on the magazine, or other performance issues in InDesign. If the extra documents don‘t have preflight errors, they shouldn’t be a problem, but it’s still recommended to store them elsewhere.

New in January:

• The Tips window got a whole lot more powerful:

• In the Actions window of Tips, type ‘tracker’ to quickly open the spreadsheet with links to the issue’s work. Or type ‘artwork’ to open the SCJ Artwork folder in Finder. Or ‘guide’ for the folder with the InDesign file. Or ‘what can you do’ for an overview of the app.

• Did you know? If you need a flyer or a poster printed, you could already use the Actions window to find and contact the duplicating offices on campus. Type ‘duplicating.’

• Multiple user accounts on your computer can now use the SCJ app, each with their own independent settings.

• Richer, more consistent and intelligent notifications.

• Log in as the senior designer to disable Adobe compatibility checks, or completely uninstall or reset the SCJ app.
