# Instructions

For any of the available configuration files, do not hit ‘Enter,’ add new paragraphs, or otherwise change the line order when adding content, which will break functionality. For long entries, keep typing on the existing provided line in perpetuity.

**Announcements**

With announcements, the senior designer can display a notification for the whole design team when they launch the SCJ app. Use your judgment to display relevant and timely information about the club or production schedule, new developments specific to the team you want communicated, or necessary technical information.

The text of the notification you want to display goes in line 2.

Marking an announcement as ‘important’ by entering ‘yes’ on line 6 changes the announcement appearance. When considered important, the announcement will appear as an alert in a window in the center of the screen, instead of a notification. The user can dismiss it by clicking a button, or it will dismiss itself after a few seconds.

To limit notification to a specific date, add the date in the format provided on line 4, and ensure the word “today” is mentioned anywhere in announcement text. To ignore the date and notify the team on all days, remove the word “today.”

**Delay SCJ Issue**

 Scripps College Journal’s app uses the magazine volume number and issue year to provide important functionality to its users.

When the magazine production schedule is changed, you want the SCJ app to be aware, so that the information it provides to users, names of design files it generates, system compatibility rules, and more accurately reflect the schedule.

Delaying SCJ issue by a semester (0.5) postpones issue value incrementing until January spring, instead of September fall. Whole integer values add years. 

If auto compatibility rules disabled (no), minimum reqs locked at Adobe CC 2021 and macOS Mojave 10.14.
